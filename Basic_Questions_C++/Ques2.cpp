// What is Data Structure ?

//  A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiency and effectively.
//  the main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and complexities.An efficient data takes minimum memory space and requires minimum 
//  time nto executes the data.
